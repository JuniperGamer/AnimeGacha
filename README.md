# AnimeGacha
AnimeGacha is a web-based gacha simulator that allows users to experience the thrill of pulling characters or items from a virtual gacha system. It is inspired by popular gacha mechanics found in various anime-themed games.

### Features
- Gacha Pulls: AnimeGacha provides two options for pulling: Single Pull and 10-Pull. Users can click the respective buttons to simulate these types of pulls.
- Rarity System: The simulator incorporates a rarity system where characters or items are classified into different rarities, such as 3-star, 4-star, and 5-star.  The probabilities of obtaining each rarity align with typical gacha mechanics.
- Pity System: AnimeGacha includes a Pity System, where players have a chance to receive a higher rarity character or item after a certain number of unsuccessful pulls. The system gradually increases the chances until a guaranteed pull is reached.
- Realistic Probability: The pull algorithm has been fine-tuned to provide a realistic representation of gacha probabilities. The chances of obtaining different rarities are adjusted to closely resemble actual gacha systems found in anime-themed games.
- Result Display: Each pull result is displayed in a clean and organized manner. The simulator shows the rarity and name of the character or item obtained from the pull, creating an immersive gacha experience.
- User-friendly Interface: The simulator features a user-friendly interface with intuitive buttons and clear result outputs. The layout has been designed for ease of use and enhanced visual appeal.
